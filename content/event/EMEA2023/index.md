summary: I presented a poster on the SENECA neuromorphic processor in the tinyML EMEA Innovation Forum 2023.
abstract: 'The lack of flexibility in most neuromorphic architecture designs results in significant performance loss and inefficient memory usage when mapping various neural network algorithms. We present SENECA, a digital neuromorphic architecture that balances the trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency using a hierarchical-controlling system. A SENECA core contains two controllers: a flexible RISC-V-based controller and an optimized controller (Loop Buffer). This flexible computational pipeline allows for deploying efficient mapping for various neural networks, on-device learning, and pre-post processing algorithms. The hierarchical-controlling system introduced in SENECA makes it one of the most efficient neuromorphic processors for event-driven neural network processing.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
